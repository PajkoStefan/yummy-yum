                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Both you and YummyYum agree, with the limited exceptions noted
                        below, to resolve all disputes between you and YummyYum through
                        BINDING ARBITRATION as further provided below. ARBITRATION MEANS
                        THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
                        OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Any dispute submitted to arbitration under these Terms and
                        Conditions will be governed by the laws of your home state of
                        residence without respect to its choice (or conflict) of laws rules.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Jurisdiction and venue for any dispute will be in Chicago, Illinois.
                        Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in that forum
                        for any and all purposes. If this paragraph would render any other
                        paragraph or provision of these Terms and Conditions unenforceable,
                        then jurisdiction and venue will instead be in your home county
                        of residence.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">The arbitration will take place in Chicago, Illinois, in accordance
                        with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                        Association. Those rules are available at: <a className="text-color-green"
                                                                      href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">This arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration
                        Act and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing
                        basis. Either party may seek enforcement of this provision in
                        any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the
                        arbitrability of a claim. The arbitral award will be judicially
                        enforceable. Any court of competent jurisdiction may, and upon
                        request shall, enter judgment on the arbitral award. Either party
                        may seek confirmation (judgment on the award) and/or enforcement
                        in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Both you and YummyYum waive the right to bring any claim covered
                        by this dispute resolution provision as a class, consolidated,
                        representative, collective, or private attorney general action,
                        or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative,
                        collective, or private attorney general action regarding any claim
                        covered by this dispute resolution provision brought by anyone else.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Notwithstanding any provision in the Consumer Arbitration Rules
                        to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or
                        any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated,
                        representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate,
                        join, or otherwise combine the claims of different persons into
                        one proceeding. If a proposed class, consolidated, representative,
                        collective, or private attorney general action arbitration is
                        initiated notwithstanding the above prohibition and it is finally
                        determined by the arbitrator (or a court of competent jurisdiction)
                        that the waiver specified herein is not enforceable, then the
                        entirety of this Dispute Resolution procedure will be null and void.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Notwithstanding the foregoing binding arbitration procedure, either
                        party may bring an individual action in small claims court (provided
                        the claim otherwise qualifies for such program) as an alternative
                        to proceeding with arbitration.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">You may elect to opt out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding
                        arbitration procedure and the class action waiver specified in
                        these Terms and Conditions by doing the following. Within 15 days
                        of creating your YummyYum account, you must send a letter to YummYum, Attn: Legal Department,

                        IL 60607 that specifies (1) your name, (2) your account member
                        name, (3) your mailing address, and (4) your request to be excluded
                        from the final, binding arbitration procedure and class action
                        waiver specified in these Terms and Conditions. All other Terms
                        and Conditions shall continue to apply to you and your account,
                        including the requirement to participate in pre-dispute mediation.
                        You are not required to send the letter by confirmed mail or return
                        receipt requested, but it is recommended that you do so. Your
                        request to be excluded will only be effective and enforceable only
                        if you can prove that the request was postmarked within the applicable
                        15-day deadline.</p>

                        your subscription or cancel your account, respectively, but we
                        reserve the right not to permit re-subscription where we have
                        previously elected to terminate your subscription.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">After placing your first order through our standard order form on
                        this Website, you will see in your online account profile how much
                        you were charged for such order. You will be charged for subsequent
                        orders at the Deadline for each such order, at which time each such
                        order will be considered final. If you elect to skip a week or weeks,
                        that does not permanently pause or cancel your subscription. If
                        you do not return to the Website to skip additional weeks or take
                        additional action, you will receive and be billed for the first
                        week you have not skipped at 12:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on
                        Friday before the following week’s delivery. Your order will cover
                        only the Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in your account.
                        We will not be obligated to supply any other Products that may have
                        been part of your order unless the dispatch of such Products has
                        been confirmed in a separate confirmation.</p>

                        by online application in order for the holder to commence delivery
                        of Products through a service. If paid for, the Voucher is deemed
                        to have been sold at the time of payment for it. All of these
                        Terms and Conditions will become applicable as between us and the

                        checkout and use of such code will be deemed to confirm your
                        agreement to these Terms and Conditions and any special conditions

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">Payments must be made by credit or debit card. We accept American

                        discretion, to reject any order or to cancel any orders placed for
                        that Product. In those circumstances, if your credit card has
                        already been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card
                        within a commercially reasonable amount of time.</p>

                        100% satisfied with the Product (because it is defective or
                        otherwise), you may request a YummyYum credit redeemable through
                        your account for the future purchase of a Product of equal value
                        thereto (a “Credit”) or a refund therefor within seven days of
                        delivery by sending an email to <a className="text-color-green"
                                                           href="mailto:support@yummyyum.com">support@yummyyum.com</a>.

                        part of
                        a Product is defective, we reserve the right to decide in our
                        discretion whether we will provide you with (A) a Credit or a
                        refund in an amount equal to the value of the defective portion(s)
                        or (B) a Credit or a full refund in an amount equal to the full
                        value of the Product. The full refund option does not apply to
                        orders larger than $100 and we reserve the right to reject requests
                        deemed to be fraudulent.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">If you refuse delivery of a Product from us because you skipped,
                        paused or canceled the order prior to the Deadline for that order,
                        and you are able to provide documentary evidence of such skip,
                        pause or cancelation (for instance, a time-stamped email), we will
                        process a Credit or a full refund (including any applicable delivery
                        charges) as soon as practicable and, in any case, within 30 days
                        of your cancelation request.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">If you refuse delivery of a Product from us for any other reason,
                        we will notify you within a reasonable period of time whether you
                        are entitled to a Credit or a refund (and, if so, the amount) by
                        phone or e-mail. If we determine that you are entitled to a Credit
                        or a refund, we will process such Credit or refund within 30 days
                        of communicating our decision to you.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">We usually provide refunds using the same method that you used to

                        damage or other issues, and to determine freshness upon delivery.
                        YummyYum packs all shipping containers with insulated liners and
                        gel packs in an effort to ensure Products are kept in a refrigerated,
                        cold environment during transit, but cannot guarantee that handling
                        during delivery may not shift Product or damage the shipping container
                        or its contents. Therefore, upon receiving your YummyYum box, you
                        should always promptly inspect your delivery to confirm that the meal
                        ingredients arrive in a cool, refrigerated condition, and the shipping
                        container and its contents are not otherwise visibly damaged. We
                        recommend that you use a food thermometer to ensure that the Product
                        temperatures within the container for any meat, poultry, seafood,
                        dairy, and cut produce Product are 40° F or below. In the unlikely
                        event the meat, poultry, seafood, dairy and/or cut produce Product
                        temperatures are found to be above 40° F, or you have any other reason
                        to believe that any other Product in your delivery is not suitable
                        for consumption, immediately contact us at <a className="text-color-green"
                                                                      href="mailto:support@yummyyum.com">support@yummyyum.com</a> and
                        then discard the item.</p>

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">To maintain the quality and safety of the Products, we recommend that
                        you immediately, upon delivery, refrigerate all perishable Products
                        upon delivery and follow all U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”)
                        guidelines on food safety for

                           target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer" > safe food handling</a>. We recommend that you follow
                        all cooking instructions as outlined in the recipe cards and verify
                        that the cooking temperatures of all meat, poultry and seafood and other
                        applicable items meet USDA’s <a className="text-color-green"
                                                        href="https://www.google.com"

                        a food
                        thermometer. We also recommend that you wash all fresh produce under
                        running water prior to using. Failure to follow safe food handling
                        practices and temperature recommendations may increase the risk of
                        foodborne illness. In addition, pregnant women, young children, the
                        elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems should follow
                        the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s <a className="text-color-green"
                                                                   href="https://www.google.com"

                    <p className="my-2 px-5">All YummyYum production facilities actively store, portion, and
                        distribute ingredients that contain all eight (8) major food allergens
                        as determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) (milk,
                        wheat, egg, soy, fish, shellfish, peanuts and tree nuts). While YummyYum
                        takes precautions to reduce the risk of cross-contamination
                        between ingredients and food products, cross-contamination may
                        unintentionally occur during production and transit which may cause
                        meals or other Products offered in connection with the YummyYum
                        service to contain some or all of those allergens. Eggs, fish,
                        shellfish, and soy are allergens that are commonly found in many
                        ingredients, especially some of the sauces that may be used in the
                        YummyYum recipes (fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, etc.). If you
                        suspect that you have an allergic reaction or other adverse health
                        event, immediately contact your health care provider. In addition,
                        due to the variable nature of ingredient availability, nutritional
                        information provided by YummyYum may differ from the nutritional
                        information published.</p>
