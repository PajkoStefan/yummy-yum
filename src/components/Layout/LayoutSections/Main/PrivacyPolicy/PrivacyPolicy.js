                    <p>You can make requests to receive copies of Personal Information
                        and to have Personal Information deleted on behalf of members of
                        your household by submitting requests on their behalf along with
                        written authorization from each member of your household.</p>

                    <p>You can also submit requests through an agent (like a membership
                        organization you belong to, your attorney, or someone else you
                        trust) that you have authorized in writing to act on your behalf.
                        To do so you’ll need to either present a power of attorney for
                        them to act on your behalf or give your agent your written
                        and signed permission to do so.</p>

                    <p>Either way, we will need to verify your identity if you want
                        copies of your Personal Information, to know about what
                        categories of Personal Information we collect and sell, or have
                        your Personal Information deleted. We will ask you to provide
                        several data points like name, address and account number to
                        match against the information we have in our systems. We have
                        this process so we can verify the identity of the consumer making
                        the request to a reasonable degree of certainty as detailed in
                        the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We want to be sure
                        that we are returning potentially sensitive information about you
                        or the things that you buy on our website only to you or your
                        agent, authorized to receive it. If we cannot verify your
                        identity, we will have to reject your request. Otherwise, we will
                        notify you when your request has been completed. In accordance
                        with the CCPA regulations, we will not disclose certain sensitive
                        information in response to a request for access to specific
                        pieces of personal information, including Social Security number,
                        driver’s license number or other government- issued
                        identification number, financial account number, any health
                        insurance or medical identification numbers, account passwords,
                        or unique biometric data. If you’re making requests on behalf of
                        your household, we will also need to verify the identities of
                        each member of your household.</p>

                    <p>In order to exercise these rights, contact us through one of the
                        methods described in “<em>Contacting Our Privacy Program</em>” below.
                        Requests are generally free of charge, and we will generally
                        process your request within 45 days unless we have a specific
                        reason for an extension of time. If for any reason we cannot
                        fulfil your request in whole or in part, we will also let you know.</p>

                    <p>We are committed to delivering great products, great experiences

                        which may include personal identifiers, demographic information,
                        behavioral information or inferences to understand the most
                        relevant product recommendations and deliver marketing messages
                        and personalized offers. Under California law, some of these
                        efforts may be considered a “sale” of personal information to
                        those analytics and advertising partners that help us match your
                        interests with brands who want to send promotions that we believe
                        save you money on products you buy frequently, and help you
                        discover new products that you might like. When we work with
                        these companies, your privacy, data integrity and security remain
                        a priority. Our normal practice is to have contractual limits on
                        their future use of your personal information and only provide
                        the minimum data necessary to accomplish the personalization task
                        and deliver a better experience and value to you as our customer.
                        We also facilitate your right to opt out of this data sharing.
                        When requesting to opt out of this type of data sharing, we will
                        need to verify your identity so we will ask you to provide
                        several data points like name, address and account number to
                        match against the information we have in our systems. We will
                        never ask for sensitive information such as passwords, Social
                        Security numbers, bank account information, or other personal
                        information. We have this process so we can verify the identity
                        of the consumer making the request to a reasonable degree of
                        certainty as detailed in the CCPA. If we cannot verify your
                        identity, we will have to reject your request. Otherwise, we will
                        notify you when your request has been completed. In order to
